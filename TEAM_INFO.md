Dataset Choice

Diabetes Progression

Dataset Number: #7

Task Type: Regression

Key Characteristic: Small sample size, continuous target variable



Why We Chose This Dataset

We met as a team and decided the Diabetes dataset is interesting because its small size allows us to see the effect of different evaluation strategies on CV variance, and it is a regression problem which is suitable for testing RMSE.



Agreed-Upon Metric

Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Why this metric: RMSE is appropriate for regression as it is in the same units as the target, penalizes larger errors more, and provides an intuitive measure of model prediction error.
